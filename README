This is a program that helps with compiling and installing the linux kernel.
It will even install a kernel on a remote machine.  This is great for working
with virtual machines.  I often use two virtual machines, one is for hacking on
the kernel, the other is for testing new kernels.

# This command will make the kernel, install it on the remote machine,
# install the modules on the remote machine, delete old kernels on the
# remote machine, and run mkinitcpio and grub-mkconfig.  After all this
# it reboots the machine.
time installkernel -s vbox-arch-kernel-testing -m -D -i -k -p -R

# This command will rsync the kernel source to the remote machine.
rsyncp -q --delete . illabout-vbox-arch-kernel-testing:`pwd`
